# FastNMF
A bare-bones NMF implementation for method optimization and development

For more exhaustive nmf implementations see "RcppML" and "singlet".

TO DO:
* GPU parallelization instead of OpenMP
* MPI distributed updates
* Incorporate cross-validation for automatic rank determination (see code in "singlet" /src)
